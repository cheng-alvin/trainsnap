**TrainSnap** is a dedicated Victorian railway gallery that aims to comprehensively document and showcase the rich and diverse 
landscape of railway infrastructure across Victoria and broader Australia. From metropolitan commuter lines to remote rural 
sidings, TrainSnap captures the essence of Australia's rail heritage and present-day operations through high-quality content.

Anything from signal boxes, trackside equipment, signage, platform architecture, depots, level crossings, we're into it! Whether 
it's a newly refurbished V/Line service, a rare locomotive movement, or an aging piece of infrastructure soon to be retired, 
TrainSnap strives to preserve these moments and details in time for rail enthusiasts, and historians for years to come.
